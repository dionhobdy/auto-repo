## ABOUT - AUTO - REPO
Auto Repo is a GitHub commit/push automation script. If your GitHub account is authenticated to your terminal, all you would have to do is enter your username and repo name. Special characters are currently not permitted for the repo name.

## UNDER - THE - HOOD
This script is currently running using 118 lines of code. Not only does it just commit - push files to the designated repo but it also runs checks to make sure the repo exists, the branch being updated is valid and even ommits itself from being uploaded via .gitignore.
